# Face Mask Detection System

This project is a real-time face mask detection system built using OpenCV. It detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not through a webcam, and if not, it triggers an alert sound.

*Originally developed during my college days as a learning project amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.*

## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade.
- Alert sound triggered if no mask is detected.
- Trained on 2,165 masked and 1,930 unmasked images.

## Model Training

The model was trained using a custom dataset consisting of:

- **2,165 images** of people wearing masks
- **1,930 images** of people without masks
